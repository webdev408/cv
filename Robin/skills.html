        <p>I am a tech enthusiast as well as a fanatic of objective assessment of projects and programmes. Subjectivity & opinions are palatable to me only if they are backed by facts. I abhor arguments like 'on the one hand we have invisible hand and on the other we can make a difference with policy intervention'. These are psudo science which can never be measured and meaningful inferences can rarely be made with any degree of confidence. That's why data science is in my blood; I eat, drink and breathe data in everything I do.</p>

    <p>I have an extensive experience in business management especially operations management and a substantial knowledge on programming for web development and data science. To a data scientist/business analyst, trinity of skills essential to be a successful (a) domain knowledge, (b) Statistics/mathematics and (c) Programming language. I possess all these with my educational background and long extensive professional experience. I am always enthusiastic to learning and practising new technologies. I am confident in meeting every challenges of data science and web development.</p>

    <h2>Some of the technologies I am currently using:</h2>
    <p>Technological advances are swift and to be abrest with it, one needs to be using latest technologies. For example bootstrap4, react & redux, CSS Grid and Flexbox are recent advances I am using in my web development work. On the data science front, I use latest on Machine learning, artificial intelligence and data visualization programs.</p>
